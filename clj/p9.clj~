;; Q: There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000. Find the product abc.
;; A: 31875000

;; LOL this works, but it's kind of ugly with the hardcoded 500 values ;)
;; (apply * (first (for [a (range 500) b (range 500) c (range 500) :when (and (= (+ a b c) 1000) (= (+ (* a a) (* b b)) (* c c)))] (list a b c))))

(loop [m 2]
  (filter #(= (apply + %) 1000)
